<hr> 2.03-dev released June 12, 2004
<p>
Contributors looking for a mission:
<p>
<ul>
<li>just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" and see what's there</ul>
CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:
<p>
<ul>
<li>This is a developer release, indicated by the "-dev" suffix on the version string. We believe the core interfaces to be stable, but some portions of the API may still need significant modification. Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer  release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified at</ul>
<a href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</a>
<p>
do not apply to developer releases.
<p>
RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:
<p>
CURRENT VOTES:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl? The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation, but never adjust Config.pm. EU::MM is smart, by accepting a  full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before resorting to Config.pm. However, if we change apreq2, we should also lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test. Otherwise our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build system will presumably still work.</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Should we replace req-&gt;body with an iterator API (added to <a class="el" href="structapreq__parser__t.html">apreq_parser_t</a>)? The rationale is that this would make xml parsing possible (xml data doesn't map naturally to apr_table_t). Xml support is a requirement for XForms. The disadvantage is that there may be a performance hit due to the additional abstractions.</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li>We are moving from cvs to subversion as soon as it is convenient. Vote was taken in March 2004 (<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001&r=1&w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</a>) and the results were as follows:</ul>

TODO:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Include perl glue for CGI environment.</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bring Perl documentation up to speed.</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write parser/hook API documentation.</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.</ul>
<ul>
<li>symbol exports files:<ol>
<li>aix needs .exp files</ol>
</ul>
OPEN ISSUES:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Should we bundle an apr-based "application/xml" parser?  If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?</ul>
BUGS:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Strange bug when ssl is enabled &amp; lots of fields are present: see <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107766265600001&r=1&w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107766265600001&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</a></ul>
<ul>
<li>Another (possibly related) bug has to do with the mfd parser misbehaving on file uploads when ssl is enabled: <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apreq-dev&m=108609005217749&w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apreq-dev&amp;m=108609005217749&amp;w=2</a></ul>
<ul>
<li>Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works properly on OSX &amp; AIX.</ul>
<ul>
<li>The current API does not handle failed query_string parsing adequately (apreq_request does log an error message, but  there's no status code in the struct for users to interrogate).</ul>
WISH LIST:
<p>
<ul>
<li>I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for one of these:</ul>
<ul>
<li>php,<li>Rivet,<li>mod_dtcl, <li>mod_python, <li>mod_jk, <li>tomcat,<li>mod_ruby,<li>mod_parrot.</ul>
