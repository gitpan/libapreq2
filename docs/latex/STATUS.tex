CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
This is a developer release, indicated by the \char`\"{}-dev\char`\"{} suffix on the version string. We believe the core interfaces to be stable, but some portions of the API may still need significant modification. Thus, binary/source compatibility may be broken from one developer  release to the next. In particular the version numbering rules specified at\end{CompactItemize}

do not apply to developer releases.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

CURRENT VOTES:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl? The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation, but never adjust Config.pm. EU::MM is smart, by accepting a  full path in \$$^\wedge$X or by searching the user's \$PATH for \$$^\wedge$X, before resorting to Config.pm. However, if we change apreq2, we should also lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test. Otherwise our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build system will presumably still work.\end{CompactItemize}

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Should we replace req-$>$body with an iterator API (added to {\bf apreq\_\-parser\_\-t} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{structapreq__parser__t})})? The rationale is that this would make xml parsing possible (xml data doesn't map naturally to apr\_\-table\_\-t). Xml support is a requirement for XForms. The disadvantage is that there may be a performance hit due to the additional abstractions.\end{CompactItemize}

We are moving from cvs to subversion as soon as it is convenient. Vote was taken in March 2004 ({\tt http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107919363000001\&r=1\&w=2}) and the results were as follows:\end{CompactItemize}

TODO:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Include perl glue for CGI environment.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Bring Perl documentation up to speed.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Write parser/hook API documentation.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Add XForms logic to the mfd parser.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
symbol exports files:\begin{enumerate}
\item 
aix needs .exp files\end{enumerate}
\end{CompactItemize}
OPEN ISSUES:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Should we bundle an apr-based \char`\"{}application/xml\char`\"{} parser?  If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr\_\-table?\end{CompactItemize}
BUGS:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Strange bug when ssl is enabled \& lots of fields are present: see {\tt http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107766265600001\&r=1\&w=2}\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Another (possibly related) bug has to do with the mfd parser misbehaving on file uploads when ssl is enabled: {\tt http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apreq-dev\&m=108609005217749\&w=2}\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Fix build automake/libtool/autoconf build system so it works properly on OSX \& AIX.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
The current API does not handle failed query\_\-string parsing adequately (apreq\_\-request does log an error message, but  there's no status code in the struct for users to interrogate).\end{CompactItemize}
WISH LIST:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
I [joes] wish folks would contribute some glue code for one of these:\end{CompactItemize}
